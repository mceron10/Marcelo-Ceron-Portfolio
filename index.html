    <!-- Concrete Canoe Project -->
    <div class="project">
        <h3>YorkU CNCC – Mix Design Team</h3>
        <p><strong>September 2024 – April 2025</strong></p>
        <p>
            Member of the York University Concrete Canoe Team, contributing to the development 
            of a lightweight and structurally optimized concrete mix for the Canadian National Concrete Canoe Competition.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Technical Contributions:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Engineered mix formulations to reduce density below 1200 kg/m³ while maintaining structural integrity</li>
            <li>Performed compressive strength testing targeting 10–20 MPa performance range</li>
            <li>Optimized workability for 10–15 mm thin hull sections</li>
            <li>Balanced cement, lightweight aggregates, and admixture ratios</li>
            <li>Ensured compliance with ASTM and ASCE competition standards</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This project strengthened my understanding of material optimization, engineering trade-offs,
            and performance-based design under real-world constraints.

    <!-- Plant Watering System -->
    <div class="project">
        <h3>Automated Plant Watering System</h3>
        <p><strong>Embedded Systems Project</strong></p>
        <p>
            Designed and built an automated plant watering system using microcontroller-based control logic
            to monitor soil moisture levels and regulate water delivery.
        </p>

        <p><strong>System Design & Implementation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Integrated soil moisture sensors to continuously monitor real-time soil conditions</li>
            <li>Programmed control logic to activate a water pump when moisture dropped below threshold</li>
            <li>Calibrated sensor readings to prevent overwatering and root damage</li>
            <li>Implemented delay logic and safety constraints to improve system reliability</li>
            <li>Tested system performance under varying environmental conditions</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This project required understanding of sensor interfacing, analog-to-digital conversion,
            embedded programming logic, and practical circuit integration. The system successfully
            automated irrigation while minimizing water waste and improving plant health consistency.
